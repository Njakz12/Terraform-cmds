To empower our development team with rapid, reliable deployments, we'll build a secure cloud foundation that automatically tests and deploys app updates. This infrastructure will feature:

## Secure Cloud Network

- A dedicated VPC with public-facing subnet

- Internet connectivity via Internet Gateway (IGW)

- Optimized routing tables for seamless traffic flow

## Smart Deployment Engine

- Auto-provisioned EC2 instance with public access

- Tight security controls (SSH + app-specific ports)

- Instant deployment via remote-exec provisioning

## Self-Testing Architecture

- Every code change automatically deployed to test environment

- Public IP endpoint for immediate team validation

- Security-hardened by design

## Key Benefit: 

- Developers get instant feedback on changes while operations maintains control over the environment.

- This solution transforms code commits into tested deployments with zero manual intervention - accelerating releases while maintaining production-grade reliability.
